Detailed explanation 

Object oriented programming 
1. class
2. object
3. polymorphism
4. Encapsulation
5. Inheritance


1. Class
----------
-> class is a collection of variables and methods (attributes and behavior)
-> class is a just virtual entity or logical entity, not a physical entity, its just gave a name to a group
-> class is a blue print its just a plan, for house based on that you create multiple houses.
-> will not occupy space in the memory.
-> Without class no objects 

Animal -->Dog, Elephant, Horse etc..
Student -->John, David, Abraham etc..
Employee -->Ram, Shaym, Ravi etc..

2. object
-------------
-> objects are derived from the class
-> one class can have multiple objects
-> object is physical entity
-> object occupies space in the memory
-> You have to create an object then you use with a new keyword

-> object is totally depends on class name ex:- class name Employee and use variable with name it holds the whole obj
-> Employee emp1 = new Employee() //object Sintex  --> class name followed by bracket is called constructor
-> Employee emp2 = new Employee()
-> We are works on the objects not for the class its just a local one
-> objects are only created with in the main method not any where, main method is compulsory for a execution.

--> class -> multiple variables & multiple methods but main is only one
--> method -> 
-> outside the method inside the class these variables are global or class variables
-> inside the method these variables are called local variables

Real Projects
---------------
-> A project contains only one main method and number of plain classes these are modules,
-> main class operates all the plain classes and all separate multiple objects are created inside the main class 
-> See in the code we create one plain class and create one main class and we are using object with access the all data
-> main class and plain class both are same package then no need to import anything otherwise
-> main class is different package and plain class is different package then you need to import 
	import packagename.classname;
