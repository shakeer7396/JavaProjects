Details of this class
 **************** Polymorphism It is a theory concept
 
 
 --> poly means - mini  -> morphism means - form     ->Mini-Forms
 --> OverLoading means One thing can have many forms.
 --> Ex Shape -> circle, square, rectangle, triangle etc.
 --> 	Water -> Wapoure, Ice etc.
 --> we can achieve polymorphism using overloading 
 
 	Same methods are used its duplicate but change parameters then overcome this is called method overloading
 	-> Return type is not considered only parameters are considered
 -> void m1() //Change  no of parameters
  -> void m1() //Order of parameters
   -> void m1() //Data type of parameters
   
  --> Two types of overloading 1.MethodvOverloading   2.Constructor Overloading
  
  ** 4.Rules should be applicable for overloading
  ------------
  1) Method name should be same
  2) Number of parameters should be different
  3) Data types of parameters should be different
  4) Order of parameters should be different
  
  
  
  **************** Encapsulation  It is a security concept
  
  -> Encapsulation means Wrapping up of data and methods into a single unit(class).
   We make then as variables private so that we cannot access anywhere else we can operate the variables only through setters and getters.
  
  1) All variables should be private
  2) For every variables there should be 2 methods (set for setting the data & get for getting the data)
  3) Variables can be operated only through methods
