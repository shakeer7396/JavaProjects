Details of this class
 **************** Polymorphism It is a theory concept
 
 
 --> poly means - mini  -> morphism means - form     ->Mini-Forms
 --> One thing can have many forms.
 --> Ex Shape -> circle, square, rectangle, triangle etc.
 --> 	Water -> Wapoure, Ice etc.
 --> we can achieve polymorphism using overloading 
 
 	Same methods are used its duplicate but change parameters then overcome this is called method overloading
 	-> Return type is not considered only parameters are considered
 -> void m1() //Change  no of parameters
  -> void m1() //Order of parameters
   -> void m1() //Data type of parameters
   
  --> Two types of overloading 1.MethodvOverloading   2.Constructor Overloading
  
  ** 4.Rules should be applicable for overloading
  ------------
  1) Method name should be same
  2) Number of parameters should be different
  3) Data types of parameters should be different
  4) Order of parameters should be different
